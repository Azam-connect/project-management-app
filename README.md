## Overview

This application helps teams and individuals manage projects, assign tasks, add comments, upload attachments, track activity logs, receive notifications, and generate reports.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Auth:** JWT (Access/Refresh tokens)
- **File Upload:** Multer
- **Validation:** Joi
- **Other:** Activity logs, report service

---

## Features

- User registration, login & JWT authentication
- Project creation, update, delete, and team management
- Task creation, assignment, status tracking (`todo`, `in-progress`, `testing`, `done`)
- File attachments for tasks (PDF, DOC/DOCX, images)
- Task comments/discussion
- Activity logs for audit/history
- Reporting: project/task stats, user stats, export as CSV

---

## Architecture

### High-Level Overview

The Project Management App follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with clear separation of frontend, backend, database, and file storage:

### Component Responsibilities

- **React Frontend:**  
  Provides user interface for login/signup, dashboard, project and task views, file uploads, comments, activity history. All data is fetched and submitted via REST API calls.

- **Node.js Express Backend:**  
  Handles REST APIs, JWT authentication (access/refresh tokens), validation (with Joi), business logic (in service layers), file uploads (Multer), error handling, activity logging.

- **MongoDB (with Mongoose):**  
  Stores all persistent data—users, projects, tasks (with comments and attachments), activity logs.

- **File Storage:**  
  Stores all uploaded attachments locally (in `/uploads/tasks/`). Attachment URLs are referenced in task documents and served statically by the API.

---

### Data Flow

1. **User actions** (e.g., create task, upload attachment, add comment) are initiated in frontend and sent to backend via HTTP REST API.
2. **Backend** validates requests (JWT & Joi), executes business logic, handles file uploads, persists changes to MongoDB, and logs activities or generates notifications when required.
3. **ActivityLog** entries are created automatically after relevant actions.
4. **Responses** flow back to frontend—UI updates for tasks, comments, files, and reports.

---

### Example: "Add Task with Attachment"

- User fills task form, selects files (attachments), and submits.
- React sends `POST /api/v1/tasks` (multipart/form-data) to backend.
- Express API validates, uses Multer to process and save files, updates database.
- File URLs stored as `attachments[]` array in Task document.
- Task is saved to MongoDB.
- ActivityLog entry created for "created task".
- UI updates on frontend.

---

### Security & Best Practices

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
- JWT (access/refresh tokens) secure all APIs.
- Only allowed file types and sizes are accepted.
- Sensitive APIs protected by middleware.
- Detailed logging for traceability and collaboration.

## Schemas

- **User:** name, email, password, role
- **Project:** title, description, createdBy, teamMembers
- **Task:** projectId, title, description, assignedTo, deadline, status, attachments, comments
- **Comment:** user, message, timestamp (embedded in Task)
- **ActivityLog:** projectId, projectTitle, taskId, user, action, detail, timestamp

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose (if running with Docker)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (for API testing)

1. **Clone repo:**  
   `git clone <repo-url> && cd <repo-folder>`
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   `npm install`
3. **Configure environment:**  
   - Create `.env` file with MongoDB URL, JWT secrets, etc.
4. **Run Seeder:**  
   - `npm run seeder` for Admin user creation
5. **Start Backend:**  
   `npm run start`
6. **Start Frontend (optional):**  
   `cd client && npm start`
7. **API Testing:**  
   Use Postman(Collection is attached in repo).


**🐳 Run with Docker (Alternative)**
-  **If you prefer Docker, after Step 1 (Clone Repo):**

1. **Run Docker Servive:**
   - `docker-compose up -d`
2. **Seed Admin user:**
   - `docker-compose exec backend npm run seeder`

## Reporting

- **Project Progress:** Task counts & completion percentage.
- **User Activity:** Task assignment & completion.
- **User Comparisons:** Task completions, overall activity.
- **Export:** Download CSV of all tasks for a project.

---

## File Upload (Attachments)

- Accepts PDFs, DOC/DOCX, images (`jpg`, `png`, `gif`, `webp`)
- Max 40 MB per file
- File URLs stored in task attachments array
- Express serves `/uploads/tasks/*` files statically

---

## Activity Log

- **Activity Log:** Every major action (create/update/comment) is logged for audit/history.

---

## Further Improvements

- Real-time notifications (Socket.io)
- Cloud uploads (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
- User roles/permissions
- Gantt charts or advanced reporting
- UI/UX enhancements & mobile responsive design
